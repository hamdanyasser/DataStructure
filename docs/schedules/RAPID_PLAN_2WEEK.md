## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Skipping Code Implementation:** Don't just read, CODE!
2. **Not Testing Edge Cases:** Always test null, empty, single element
3. **Cramming:** Spread study evenly, don't leave everything to last day
4. **Ignoring Weak Areas:** Face your weaknesses, don't avoid them
5. **Burning Out:** Take 10-min breaks every hour, sleep 7-8 hours

---

## 💡 Study Tips

1. **Pomodoro Technique:** 25 min focus + 5 min break
2. **Active Recall:** Close book, try to explain/code from memory
3. **Teach Others:** Explain concepts to friend/family/rubber duck
4. **Handwrite:** Practice coding on paper (like actual exams!)
5. **Mix Topics:** Don't do 3 hours straight on one topic
